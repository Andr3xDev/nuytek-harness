# Builder

## Structure

1. The **Builder** interface declares product construction steps that are common to all types of builders.
2. **Concrete Builders** provide different implementations of the construction steps. Concrete builders may produce products that don’t follow the common interface.
3. **Products** are resulting objects. Products constructed by different builders don’t have to belong to the same class hierarchy or interface.
4. The **Director** class defines the order in which to call construction steps, so you can create and reuse specific configurations of products.
5. The **Client** must associate one of the builder objects with the director. Usually, it’s done just once, via parameters of the director’s constructor. Then the director uses that builder object for all further construction. However, there’s an alternative approach for when the client passes the builder object to the production method of the director. In this case, you can use a different builder each time you produce something with the director.

## Relations with Other Patterns

- Many designs start by using **Factory Method** (less complicated and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward **Abstract Factory**, **Prototype**, or **Builder** (more flexible, but more complicated).

- **Builder** focuses on constructing complex objects step by step. **Abstract Factory** specializes in creating families of related objects. **Abstract Factory** returns the product immediately, whereas **Builder** lets you run some additional construction steps before fetching the product.

- You can use **Builder** when creating complex **Composite** trees because you can program its construction steps to work recursively.

- You can combine **Builder** with **Bridge**: the director class plays the role of the abstraction, while different builders act as implementations.

- **Abstract Factories**, **Builders** and **Prototypes** can all be implemented as **Singletons**.
